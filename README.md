# ZW API

Welcome to the ZW API project! This project aims to provide the API for the ZW platform, a comprehensive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and customer portal specifically designed for recycling companies.

### Introduction

Many locations face significant challenges with waste management, where official recycling efforts are struggling, resulting in only a small percentage of waste being recycled. In response to this issue, many private recycling companies are emerging to help address the problem.

One of the primary challenges these new recycling companies face is the lack of an affordable and efficient CRM system to manage customer databases, subscriptions, pickup routes, and other essential operations. The ZW platform aims to fill this gap by providing a basic yet powerful CRM solution for free or at a very low cost, simplifying the process of starting and managing a recycling company.
